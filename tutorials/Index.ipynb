It also shows more examples of generating plots, with the plotHandler class as well as directly with metricBundles. It also introduces the use of metric data outside of the MAF metricBundle, including read data back from disk. There are lots of concepts used in this notebook (we'll split it up eventually). \n",

    "[Compare Runs](./Compare Runs.ipynb) This notebook looks at how you can grab summary statistic data from the results databases of multiple opsim runs (where you've already calculated metrics and generated summary statistics). With the summary statistics you could compare (for example) the number of visits or the mean proper motion accuracy, from many different simulated surveys. \n",
